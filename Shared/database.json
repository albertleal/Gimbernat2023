      "description": "Ristretto is an espresso capsule that delivers an intense and bold coffee experience. This espresso is made from a blend of the finest Arabica and Robusta beans, selected and roasted to perfection to bring out their rich flavors and aroma. With its short extraction time and reduced water volume, ristretto is known for its strong and concentrated flavor, which is both smooth and satisfying. The coffee has a thick and creamy texture with hints of dark chocolate and caramel, making it perfect for those who prefer a more robust coffee. Ristretto is a great choice for espresso lovers who want a full-bodied, bold coffee experience that is sure to awaken the senses and start the day off right. Whether enjoyed on its own or used as a base for other coffee beverages, ristretto is a true coffee lover's delight.",
